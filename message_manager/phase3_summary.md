# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
In Phase 3, we successfully implemented the WebSocket functionality for the message manager. This enables real-time communication between hotel staff and guests through department-based messaging.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Django Channels Configuration
- Updated `lobbybee/config/base.py` to include ASGI application configuration
- Configured `CHANNEL_LAYERS` to use Redis as the backend
- Added proper settings for WebSocket support

### 2. WebSocket Consumers
- Created `message_manager/consumers.py` with `StaffConsumer` class
- Implemented authentication checks for WebSocket connections
- Added support for subscribing/unsubscribing to conversation groups
- Implemented message handling for staff-to-guest communication
- Integrated database persistence for staff messages

### 3. Routing Configuration
- Created `message_manager/routing.py` to define WebSocket URL patterns
- Mapped `/ws/staff/` endpoint to `StaffConsumer`

### 4. ASGI Application Update
- Updated `lobbybee/asgi.py` to use `ProtocolTypeRouter`
- Integrated authentication middleware for WebSocket connections
- Added routing for message manager WebSocket endpoints

### 5. WebSocket Notification System
- Enhanced `message_manager/services/websocket_utils.py` with real implementation
- Added `notify_department_new_conversation()` function to send notifications to departments
- Implemented group-based messaging using Django Channels

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- Created `message_manager/tests/test_websocket.py` for consumer tests
- Created `message_manager/tests/test_websocket_utils.py` for utility function tests
- Updated test documentation in `message_manager/tests/README.md`
- All tests pass successfully

## Technical Details

### StaffConsumer Features
- Authentication verification for all connections
- Group management for staff members and conversations
- Real-time message broadcasting to conversation participants
- Database persistence for all staff messages
- WhatsApp integration placeholders for future implementation

### Department Notification System
- Automatic notification when conversations are routed to departments
- Group-based messaging to all staff members in a department
- Proper error handling for conversations without departments

### Security Considerations
- Authentication required for all WebSocket connections
- Proper user verification before allowing message sending
- Secure group management to prevent unauthorized access

## Integration Points
The WebSocket implementation integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing conversation flow system
- Department routing functionality
- Message persistence in the database
- Future WhatsApp API integration

## Testing Coverage
- Consumer instantiation and basic functionality
- WebSocket utility functions for department notifications
- Channel layer group messaging
- Error handling for edge cases

## Next Steps
With Phase 3 complete, the message manager now supports:
1. Real-time communication between staff and guests
2. Department-based message routing
3. Persistent message storage
4. Scalable WebSocket architecture

This sets the foundation for Phase 4: REST API for Staff Interface.
