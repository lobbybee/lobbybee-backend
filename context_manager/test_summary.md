## Issues with Existing Tests

1. The tests were written before the services.py and views were fully implemented
2. Some tests may not align with the current implementation
3. There's no comprehensive test coverage for the new views

## Plan for New Tests

1. Create comprehensive tests for services
2. Create comprehensive tests for views
3. Ensure all functionality is properly tested
4. Test edge cases and error conditions
